# Living Notes

> **Source of truth:** `../project-wiki/index.md`. This file summarizes for agents; the wiki is canonical.

> Active state, open questions, and notes that don't fit elsewhere. Keep current. Archive resolved items.

## Quick Reference

- **Purpose**: Current state snapshot + open items + gotchas
- **Update**: When a phase completes, when an issue lands, when a question resolves

## Current state (2026-05-04)

**Completed:**
- ✅ **Phase 0** — Repo init, root scaffolding, `.opencode/reference/raw-handoff/2026-04-19/` imported, branch protection on `main`.
- ✅ **Phase 1** — Astro 6 + React 19 in `app/`, TypeScript strict, PostCSS toolchain (autoprefixer + nesting + custom-media), all `app/src/{content,layouts,lib,pages,styles}/` scaffolded, `Base.astro` + shell `index.astro`, content contracts hardened (PRs #4, #5, #6 on the working branch).
- ✅ **Phase 2** — Component port complete (`app/src/components/*.astro` + `islands/ProjectFilter.tsx`) with responsive tuning in `app/src/styles/phase2.css`.
- ✅ **Phase 3** — Testing stack in place (Vitest + Playwright + Lighthouse CI) with unit/E2E suites and committed responsive snapshots.
- ✅ **Phase 4** — Containerization implemented on branch (`app/Dockerfile`, `app/nginx.conf`, `app/.dockerignore`) with local Docker build/run/health/header verification and a 50MB runtime baseline gate.

**In flight:**
- 🚧 **Phase 5** — Infrastructure provisioning prep (`infra/terraform/` scaffolding and local `terraform init/plan` workflow).

**Branch state:** `feature/phase-4-containerization` contains Phase 4 runtime implementation and docs synchronization, with PR #10 opened against `main`. `.opencode/` remains canonical for agentic docs; legacy docs stay temporary backup.

## Open questions (deferred, from `../project-wiki/index.md`)

| # | Question | Decide by | Status |
|---|----------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Hetzner region (`nbg1` default vs `ash`/`hil`) | Before Phase 5 `terraform apply` | Open |
| 2 | ArgoCD admin password — default or age-encrypted | Phase 6 | Deferred, port-forward is fine for P1 |
| 3 | Analytics tool (Plausible/GoatCounter/Umami/none) | Post-ship | Deferred |
| 4 | Case Study page — Phase 2.5? | After domain swap | Deferred |
| 5 | Self-hosted fonts vs Google Fonts | Phase 3 if Lighthouse perf < 95 | Deferred |
| 6 | Dark mode toggle | Only if reviewer feedback | Deferred |
| 7 | Cross-browser test matrix (Firefox/WebKit) | Phase 3+ | Deferred |
| 8 | Repo visibility (public vs private) | Before first push | Recommend public |

## Accepted trade-offs (active, from `../project-wiki/operations.md`)

These are not problems to fix — they're known compromises kept with intent. Flagged here so agents don't "help" by changing them.

- **Single-node k3s = SPOF** — accepted, Vercel fallback documented.
- **Bootstrap not fully git-only once Phase 2 secrets exist** (age key must be manually restored before sync) — accepted at this scale, runbook step documented.
- **Custom `argocd-repo-server-ksops` image maintenance** — accepted, pinned and rebuilt with ArgoCD upgrades.
- **Cloudflare token split across Terraform + SOPS in Phase 2** — accepted, one cutover checklist covers both.
- **KSOPS blast radius** — accepted with 6 compensating controls; Phase 3 narrowing path documented.

## Known risks being monitored (from `../project-wiki/operations.md`)

| Risk | Likelihood | Monitoring |
|------|------------|------------|
| k3s OOM on CX11 (2GB) under full stack | Med | `kubectl top` after Phase 6 bootstrap; upgrade to CX21 if >75% sustained |
| LE HTTP-01 fails on first issue during cloud-init | Low | cloud-init waits for ingress; manual `kubectl delete certificate` retry |
| CI bot commit loop | Low | Path filters + staged-diff guard; test in Phase 7 |
| New Claude Design handoff breaks content contract | Med | `tsc --noEmit` in CI surfaces the break |
| Lighthouse CI flakes on cold runs | Med | `numberOfRuns: 3` averages |

## Gotchas for agents working here

1. **Do NOT touch `.opencode/context/project-wiki/index.md` without asking** — it's the canonical wiki index. Suggest changes, don't apply them.
2. **`.opencode/reference/raw-handoff/2026-04-19/*` is immutable** — original Claude Design export, reference only.
3. **Content types are load-bearing** — `app/src/lib/types.ts` is the contract between content and components. Changing types = breaking contract = CI catches it but you still need to update content files.
4. **One React island rule** — `islands/ProjectFilter.tsx` is the ONLY allowed client-hydrated component. Mobile nav uses `<details>`, no JS. Violating this needs an ADR.
5. **No `.github/workflows/terraform.yml` in Phase 1** — Terraform is local-only until Phase 1.5 remote state. Don't "add CI for completeness."
6. **Kubeconfig is `0600` on the node** — `sudo` required for `kubectl`. Documented UX cost; don't "fix" it.
7. **Image tags are git SHAs, never `latest`** — paired with `imagePullPolicy: Always`.

## Patterns worth preserving

- **Frontmatter-based typed content** (`app/src/content/*.ts` with types from `lib/types.ts`) — any new content type follows this pattern.
- **MVI for context docs** — every `.opencode/context/**/*.md` file stays under 200 lines.
- **ADR format** — Nygard body + `type: project` frontmatter, qmd-queryable.

## Onboarding for a new agent/session

1. Read `navigation.md` (sibling file).
2. Read `business-domain.md` for goals.
3. Read `technical-domain.md` for stack + current state.
4. Read this file for open items + gotchas.
5. Read `../project-wiki/index.md` and relevant topic pages (`architecture.md`, `deployment.md`, `infrastructure.md`, `operations.md`, `testing.md`) for canonical detail on the specific area you're touching.
